# Review: Callback Functions

In Javascript, functions are first-class objects that behave in the same way as other objects in Javascript. This means that functions can be given as a parameter to another function. 

When a function is passed as an argument to another function, this is known as a callback.

**Example:**

```javascript

function dance() {
    console.log("I'm moving my body to the groove.");
}

function sing(song, dance) {
    console.log(`I'm singing along to ${song}.`);
    dance();
}

sing("Holla Back Girl", dance);

//expected output
=> "I'm singing along to Holla Back Girl."
=> "I'm moving my body to the groove."

```

# Array Iterators
Arrays have a number of methods that utilize callbacks to make them more flexible.

In this lesson, we'll be talking about: 
  ### .forEach, .map, .filter, .reduce, .find

For the following lesson please review [For Loops](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for)!


## [.forEach()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/forEach)

We already know that we can use a for loop could be used to loop through each value in an array like so:

```javascript

const arr = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']

for (let i=0; i < arr.length; i++) {
  console.log(arr[i])
}

//expected output
=> 'a'
=> 'b'
=> 'c'
=> 'd'
=> 'e'

```

Why write for loops over and over? they involve way too much writing, they're prone to syntactical errors.

Now we can call the **.forEach()** method on any array:

```javascript

const arr = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']

arr.forEach(function(element){
    console.log(element)
})

//expected output
=> 'a'
=> 'b'
=> 'c'
=> 'd'
=> 'e'
```

-----

Next, let's try the **.forEach()** method with an anonymous arrow function. 

[For Review: 
ES6 Arrow Function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions)

We can pass in three optional arguments for the .forEach method: 
* element value
* element index
* array being traversed.


```javascript

const arr = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']

arr.forEach((element, i, array) => {
    console.log(`this is ${element}, this is the index ${i}, this is the array being traversed: ${array}`)
})

//expected output
=> "this is a, this is the index 0, this is the array being traversed: a,b,c,d,e"
=> "this is b, this is the index 1, this is the array being traversed: a,b,c,d,e"
=> "this is c, this is the index 2, this is the array being traversed: a,b,c,d,e"
=> "this is d, this is the index 3, this is the array being traversed: a,b,c,d,e"
=> "this is e, this is the index 4, this is the array being traversed: a,b,c,d,e"

```

-----

## [.map()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map)

The map() method is very similar to the forEach() method. It also iterates over an array, and takes a callback function as a parameter that is invoked on each item in the array. This is often used to process data returned from databases in array form, such as adding HTML tags to plain text. 

_The difference between .forEach() and .map() is that .map() returns a **new array** that replaces each value with the return value of the callback function._


Use the `.map()` method on any array, it will return a new array with new mutated values. 

```javascript

let arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

const mapped = arr.map( d => d * 2 ); 

console.log(mapped)

//expected output:
=> [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]

```
Here is an example of using .map() with HTML elements. You'll be seeing this more when you get to GA and start using React!

```javascript
['red','green','blue'].map( color => `<p> ${color.toUpperCase()}</p>` );


//expected output:
=> ['<p>RED</p>', '<p>GREEN</p>', '<p>BLUE</p>']
```


## [.filter()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter)

This method creates a new array with all the elements that pass the test implemented by the function... or it FILTERS everything you're not looking for. 

The filter() method returns a new array that only contains items from the original array that return true when passed to the callback. 


```javascript

let names = ["Carlos", "Dmitriy", "Angel", "Ester", "Alberto", "Magnardo"]

const filtered = names.filter( name => name.length > 5); 

console.log(filtered)

//expected output: 

["Carlos", "Dmitriy", "Alberto", "Magnardo"]

```


## [.reduce()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/Reduce)

The reduce() method is another method that iterates over each value in the array, but this time it cumulatively combines each result to return just a single value. 

A callback function is used to describe how to combine each value of the array with the running total.

The callback usually takes two parameters: 
* The first parameter represents the **accumulated value** of all the calculations so far
* The second parameter represents the **current value** in the array. 

```javascript
let arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]; 
let reducer = (accumulator, value) => {
    return accumulator + value; 
}
let newArr = arr.reduce(reducer)

//expected output
=> 28

```

#### RECAP:

The `reduce()` method executes a reducer function (that you provide) on each member of the array against an accumulator and each element in the array (from left to right) to be *REDUCED* to a single value


-----

### PRACTICE: Chaining methods together

**What value do you get when you execute this chain of array iterators?**
```javascript
[1,2,3].map( x => x*x ).reduce((acc,x) => acc + x );


//expected output
=> 
```

**How about this one?**
```javascript
const sales = [ 100, 230, 55];
totalAfterTaxSales = sales.map( (amount) => amount * 1.15 ).reduce( (acc,val) => acc + val );

//expected output
=> 
```

-----

## [.find()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/find)

Use the `.find()` method on any array and it returns the **value** of the **first element** in the array that satisfies the callback function and returns a TRUE value. Otherwise `undefined` is returned. Just like the .forEach() method, the callback function also can take three arguments, but we will save this for another lesson.

```javascript

const arr = [5, 6, 30, 35, 90, 130,  9]; 

let found = arr.find((d) => {
    return d > 30; 
});

console.log(found); 

//expected output
=> 35

```


.find() does not **mutate** the array on which it is called. That means it returns a new value without changing the old array, just like .map()
